    "What is OOP?": ["OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming. It is a programming paradigm that relies on the concept of objects. Objects are data structures that contain both data and code. In OOP, objects are used to model real-world entities. For example, in a program that models a bank account, there would be an object for the account holder, an object for the account balance, and an object for the account transactions. OOP is beneficial because it allows for code reuse. That is, once an object is created, it can be used in multiple places throughout a program. This makes development faster and easier. Additionally, OOP makes it easier to maintain and modify code. Because code is organized into objects, it is simpler to locate the code that needs to be changed. Finally, OOP allows for code to be better organized and easier to read.", "1. OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming. \n2. OOP is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of objects. \n3. Objects are the basic building blocks of an OOP program. \n4. Objects are created from templates called classes. \n5. Objects can interact with each other to perform tasks. \n6. OOP programs are typically organized into modules. \n7. OOP provides many benefits over other programming paradigms, including increased modularity and code reuse."]
